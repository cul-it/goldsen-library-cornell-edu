				<br><br>
				The Wen Pulin Archive of Chinese Avant Garde Art contains some 360 hours of digital video documenting the history of contemporary Chinese art, installation, and performance since 1985.  Organized by Thomas Hahn, Curator of the Wason Collection, and Timothy Murray, Curator of the Rose Goldsen Archive, the Wen Pulin Archive is a unique international resource of video footage of art events, art performances, installations, and artist studio tours and interviews that traces the history of Chinese culture over this consequential twenty year period. This unique collection, which, due to the sensitive nature of its materials, is at present still restricted in use in China, will provide students and researchers with previously unseen documentation of the important developments in contemporary art in China over the past twenty years, the period of China's tremendous growth into a major venue of contemporary art and global culture.  Cornell's acquisition of the Wen Archive marks the first of many planned collaborations with the new Dongtai Academy of Arts in Beijing, which is directed by its founder, Wen Pulin.
