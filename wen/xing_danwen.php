<p align="justify">XING Danwen (???) (Born 1967)</p>
<p align="justify">Xing Danwen started with painting at the Xi’an
Academy of Fine Arts in her hometown, and continued at the Central
academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Later in 1998, she went to New York
with a fellowship and grant received from Asian Cultural Council in New
York. There she received a Master degree of fine art in photography and
multimedia from School of Visual Arts in New York. She currently lives
and works in Beijing. Xing Danwen is one of the rare internationally
recognized women among the Chinese contemporary artists.</p>
<p align="justify">Her particular works - a strong and sensitive view
on the society - has been noticed for more ten years through her
exhibitions around the globe. In her most recent work <i>“Urban Fiction”, </i>
Xing Danwen photographs the maquettes of the new architecture in China
and the modern urban landscape with their disproportion, their
dehumanized aspect, sometimes with their grotesque lights and colors.
With this stratagem, Xing Danwen attracts our attention on the
consequences this important upheaval the China urban universe is
currently subjected to: the disappearance of the inheritance and the
references to the former generations, this new world of cold buildings
where the human appears terribly ridiculous and alone. In another
series of her works, <i>disCONNEXION</i>,
the artist shows large piles of computer trashes, criticizing the
consumer society and environment nightmares, but succeeding to extract
a kind of beauty from these residues.</p>
