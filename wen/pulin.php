<p align="justify"><strong>Wen Pulin 温普林</strong> (“盲流艺术家”), born in Liaoning 
        province in 1957, of Manchu origins.</p>
                    
      <p align="justify">Wen graduated in 1985 from the central Academy of Fine 
        Arts in Beijing, with a major in film. It appears that Wen’s life has 
        two central themes – contemporary expressions of art in China, and the 
        cultures and traditions of Tibet. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In the first instance, the rise (not the marketing) of especially performance 
        art can hardly be envisioned without him. As a trained film director, 
        he initiated and was responsible for the recording of many art-related 
        events, such as the Great Wall performance with Xu Bing and others in 
        1988 (the so-called Great Earthquake 大地震). An accomplished artist and 
        author himself, Wen was probably the earliest organizer of such artistic 
        gatherings and “happenings”, whether they were held with or without official 
        approval. As a systematic cinematic author and recorder, over the years 
        he created a visual archive of great depth and value, spanning the crucial 
        time period from 1985 to 2002. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The second great interest of Wen, in things Tibetan, the Great West of 
        China as it is sometimes called, began with a trip in 1986, and an extended 
        stay after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. Every year, Wen spends 
        at least two months in Tibet; one of his sons (aged 14 at the point of 
        this writing) is a so-called “Living Buddha 活佛”; he personally donated 
        funds to restore Tibetan temples, and re-introduced the subject of Tibetan 
        culture to a Chinese audience which had become increasingly politicized 
        about the subject. His publications and documentaries (including one on 
        <i>Celestial Burial</i> 達木天葬台) feature Tibetan religious customs, the 
        arts, vanishing life styles and value systems. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Books by Wen Pulin include chronicles of live in Tibet, such as <i>Ba 
        qie Living Buddha </i> 巴伽活佛 (published first in 2000, this book was printed 
        in over one million copies); a volume on the recent history of Chinese 
        performance art (Zhongguo xingdong中国行动, 1999); he also edited a bi-lingual 
        journal called Xizang renwen dili 西藏人文地理<i> Tibet Geography</i>; his film 
        <i>Pa-dga' Living Buddha</i> was shown at the 18th Hong Kong International 
        Film Festival in April 1994. <br>
