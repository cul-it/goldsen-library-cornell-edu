<p align="justify">DU Zhenjun (???) (Born 1961)</p>
<p align="justify">Born on March 12, 1961 in Shanghai, Du Zhenjun
received diplomas from the Institute of arts and trades in Shanghai and
the School of Fine Arts of the University of Shanghai. After 1990 he
moved to France and received a Master degree from the Regional School
of Fine Arts of Rennes, France in 1999. He is currently living in
France.</p>
<p align="justify">Although trained as a sculptor, Du Zhenjun is most
interested in creating interactive installation works. He is one of the
first generation of artists who incorporate digital technologies into
art pieces, and his 2003 exhibition in Paris, “Too Heavy for Human
Beings”, was applauded as the first solo exhibition in French digital
art history. Most of Du Zhenjun’s installations explore the human
tragedies, as exemplified by one of his earlier works, <i>Chienman</i>,
in which a half-man, half-dog digital creature splits into two halves
and starts biting each other once the audience touches the screen on
which the creature is projected. In Du Zhenjun’s works, the ecstasy of
behavior takes crucial position, and this ecstasy is usually
accompanied by Du Zhenjun’s attention to human beings’ suffering and
challenges. By involving the audience and even trapping them inside his
works and forcing them to play a central role, Du Zhenjun rejects the
traditionally skill-centered art and calls for a greater care of
humanity.</p>
