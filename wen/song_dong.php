<p align="justify">SONG Dong (??) (Born 1966)</p>
<p align="justify">Song Dong graduated from Fine Arts Department,
National Normal University of China in 1989, and taught in a high
school in Beijing until 2000, when he resigned and became a full time
artist. Song Dong has been a significant figure in the development of
Chinese conceptual art since the early 1990s. His practice incorporates
performance, photography, projection, video and installation.</p>
<p align="justify">Emerging from a strong Beijing-based avant-garde
performance art community, Song Dong explores notions of perception and
the ephemeral nature of existence. His political and financial
circumstances have encouraged a solitary, meditative way of working in
which ideas are expressed through inexpensive materials and small-scale
works. In his photographic series and short video pieces, Song Dong
uses sequenced images to explore a rapidly modernizing China and to
capture notions of transience and illusion in contemporary society. In
his recent works, he focuses on the migrant workers in China â€“ a group
vital for the rapid industrialization but commonly viewed as a growing
social problem. Using factories and agricultural products expo as
exhibition media, and by enabling the audience to directly interact
with the participating migrant workers, Song Dong tries to invoke the
audience to see the complexity of this social group through a new
perspective.</p>
