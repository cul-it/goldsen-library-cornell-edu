<p align="justify">YU Xiaofu (???) (Born 1950)</p>
<p align="justify">Graduated from Department of Fine Arts, Shanghai
Theatre Academy in 1978, Yu Xiaofu was admitted into Shanghai Oil
Painting and Sculpture Studio and became a professional artist. He is
currently a professor in Shanghai Institute of Oil Painting and
Sculpture and Shanghai University. A staunch advocate of traditional
art skills, Yu Xiaofu specializes in oil paintings on canvas. His early
paintings were heavily influenced by Russian realism artists such as
Repin and Serov. Later he became interested in the group of Les Nabis
and Cubism, as well as the Romanian artist, Corneliu Baba. </p>
<p align="justify">Yu Xiaofu’s paintings are always profoundly involved
with historical connotations. He enjoys painting grand narrative scenes
consisting of famous historical figures and himself, meanwhile placing
great emphasis on brush skills and composition. In his recent painting,
<i>My Spiritual Homeland</i>, he arranged himself standing beside Carl
Marx, Anselm Kiefer and Joseph Beuys in a junkyard setting, signifying
his strong faith in traditional humanity spirit in the modern
disoriented society. His other major paintings include <i>Gadameilin</i>,<i> Displacement</i>, and <i>The Piano Series</i>, some of them being housed in The Pacific Asia Museum, CA.</p>
