<p align="justify">MOU Sen (??) (Born 1963)</p>
<p align="justify">Mou Sen is a forerunner of China’s experimental
theatre and one of the most internationally acclaimed theatre directors
in China. He was admitted into Chinese Language Department, Beijing
Normal University in 1980, and later spent two years directing in Tibet
Theatre Company. In 1987 he returned to Beijing and set up the first
independent theatre in China, Frog Experimental Theatre. In 1993, he
established <i>Xi Ju Che Jian</i>, or Garage Theatre, to continue his
theatrical experimentation in alternative underground spaces. He quit
directing in 1997 due to poor box office, but returned in 2002 as a
literature advisor and repertoire producer. </p>
<p align="justify">Mou Sen’s important theatre productions include <i>The Other Shore, File Zero, About AIDS</i>, and <i>Red Herring</i>.
He advocates that theatres should be a place for the interaction of the
souls, while strongly opposing the dogmatic following of Stanislavski’s
drama system, which is commonplace in China’s official academies. He
once said in an interview, “I use the theatre to help people learn how
to handle their obstacles, trying to overcome them while knowing they
will never get completely rid of them. This is the process of
self-education.” His theatre work, <i>File Zero</i>, which toured
around Europe and North America, is commonly interpreted as an implicit
critique of dominant ideologies directing at the Communist government.</p>
