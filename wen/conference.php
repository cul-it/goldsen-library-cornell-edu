				  In addition to providing a preview 
                    of these materials, open for the public viewing in the Wason 
                    Collection and Goldsen Archive, Kroch Library, the conference 
                    provides one of the largest North American gatherings of contemporary 
                    Chinese artists and curators who work in the emergent fields 
                    of electronic arts, new media, and mixed media performance. 
                    Their aim is to situate their past and current projects in 
                    terms of the theoretical, social, and political problems posed 
                    by new archival challenges of digital culture and historical 
                    transformation. <br><br>
              Similarly the endeavor of archiving so-called ephemeral artistic 
              works may require a reconsideration of the aims and imperative of 
              the archive itself and related art historical research. To position 
              contemporary Chinese art in the Future Perfect will require that 
              the participants reflect on their former work in relation to future 
              concerns: to consider &quot;what they will have done&quot; (and 
              how it will have been remembered).<br><br>
              Highlights of the weekend include the international premiere of 
              a new performance art piece by the artist, Lin Yilin, on Saturday 
              afternoon at 4pm, and a plenary artist presentation by the internationally 
              celebrated artist Xu Bing, on Friday afternoon at 4:30pm. They will 
              be joined by the artists, Feng Mengbo and Chen Lingyang from Beijing, 
              Du Zhenjun from Paris, Xiaowen Chen from Ithaca, Lin Yan from New 
              York as well as curators Barbara London (Museum of Modern Art), 
              Gao Minglu (Pittsburgh), and Shin-Yi Yang (Artist Commune, Hong 
              Kong).
