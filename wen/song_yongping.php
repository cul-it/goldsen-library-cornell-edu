<p align="justify">SONG Yongping (???) (Born 1961)</p>
<p align="justify">Song Yongping was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province,
and graduated from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts in 1983. He is
currently lecturing in National Institute of Film and Broadcasting.
Trained as a painter, Song Yongping is an artist that works with a
variety of mediums including photography, painting and performance.</p>
<p align="justify">Song Yongping emerged in the 1990s as a member of
the artist group that created the style of “New Pictures of the
Floating World” (Xin fushihui), the name stemming from the ancient
Japanese genre ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world), which can also
mean “pictures of the sad world”. Concerned with the impact of economic
reformation on the society, Song Yongping tries to show his
understanding and reflection on the living attitude through his
satirical paintings. From 1998 to 2000, Song Yongping engaged in a
series of photography works titled <i>My Parents</i>. Filled with
humane sensibility, these photos faithfully recorded his bedridden
parents’ daily life in a dilapidated apartment. Over the course of the
series the artist's parents crumple through disease and grief, with the
artist often appearing in the same poses, garments, and even medical
apparatus, standing as empathic witness to their loss and his own. This
photography series attracted wide international attention and was
recently acquired by the Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago.</p>
