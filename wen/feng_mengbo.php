<p align="justify">FENG Mengbo (???) (Born 1966)</p>
<p align="justify">Born in Beijing in 1966, the first of year of the
Cultural Revolution, Feng Mengbo studied at Design Department of
Beijing School of Arts and Crafts and later graduated from the
Printmaking Department of Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. As an
avid video-gamer, Feng Mengbo’s works involve heavily manipulating the
modern computer technology.</p>
<p align="justify">In the early nineties, Feng Mengbo created a series
of computer-generated paintings which include grafting Mao Zedong’s
symbolic hand waving image onto a picture of yellow taxi. During this
period, Mao Zedong is a recurring theme in his works. Starting from
1996, Feng Mengbo has shifted his major interest into interactive art
that commonly uses CD-ROMs as media. In his first interative CD-ROM, My
Private Life, a collection of photos mixing personal experience with
memorable historical events are presented to the viewers on a screen,
and the viewers can change the order of the appearance of the photos
through mouse and keyboard. Another of his works, Taking Mt. Doom by
Strategy, links the high-tech game aesthetics of the West and the
traditional staging of the Beijing opera to explore the history and
meaning of the Cultural Revolution in China. It is based on a mixing of
the video game Doom with the opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy
from the Cultural Revolution era and includes 42 clips from the film of
the same title. </p>
