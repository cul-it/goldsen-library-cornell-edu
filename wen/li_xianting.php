<p align="justify">LI Xianting (???) (Born 1949)</p>
<p align="justify">Born in Jilin Province, Li Xianting is a renowned
art critic and sometimes referred to as the “Godfather of Chinese
contemporary avant-garde art”. He graduated from Chinese Painting
Department, Central Academy of Fine Art in 1978, and became the editor
of <i>Fine Art Magzine</i> until 1983. From 1985 to 1989 he was the editor of the authoritative <i>China Fine Art Newspaper</i>, and was active as independent critic and curator based in Beijing henceforth.</p>
<p align="justify">In the late seventies and eighties, Li Xianting was
a major force in advocating and introducing the burgeoning avant-garde
art in China, which just embarked on economic reformation. He organized
the pivotal “Stars exhibition” in 1979, and coined the terms “Cynical
Realism” and “Political Pop”, which later became the dominant schools
of Chinese avant-garde art. Into the 90s, Li Xianting continued to
organize major avant-garde art events both inside and outside of China,
while settling in Song Zhuang, a small village near Beijing, which
hence transformed into the largest artist “colony” in China. Many
artists he discovered and promoted, such as Fang Lijun and Wang
Guangyi, have received great international attention and become leading
figures in Chinese avant-garde art movement.</p>
